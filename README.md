"Changes in assets per Bitcoin trade"

This project shows the changes of assets associated with Bitcoin trading. It begins with an initial investment of $1,000 on the first day of 2019, tracking the asset value through to 2024. The strategy involves purchasing Bitcoin every Saturday at the "Open" price and selling it every Wednesday. 
Two scenarios are considered: the first involves selling Bitcoin at the "Close" price, while the second entails selling at the "High" price. By analyzing both scenarios, we aim to visualize the fluctuations in asset value resulting from each Bitcoin trade and determine the final asset values on the concluding day.
